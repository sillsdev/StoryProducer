09/22/2021 - DKH Update for Testing Abstraction #566

This is the test data directory for GIT SHA1: 0661464cb5d6e6cd04f9b3c62f5ca392800c1e21
The test data is loaded onto the target emulator or phone in the root
directory (ie, /). Once the test data is loaded, the
tests in 'org.tyndalebt.spadv.androidtest.happypath' are run. A total of 23
tests will be run.  For Android 8 & 9 on an emulator, all 23 test run successfully. 
For Android 10 & 11 on an emulator, a few tests fail due to the scoped storage
requirement which  was introduced in Android 10 & 11.  For the Android 11
phone, only a few tests passed.

This test data has been tested on the following targets:
Android  8, Pixel 3 on an Android Studio Emulator.
Android  9, Pixel 2 on an Android Studio Emulator.
Android 10, Pixel 4 on an Android Studio Emulator.
Android 11, Pixel 4 on an Android Studio Emulator.
Android 11, Pixel 5 phone.  

To reduce the overall storage space and the number of GIT files, a windows zip
file is used in the turnover to GIT. Uncompress the testData.zip file and the
top level directory will be "sdcard".

To load the data into the target platform, use the adb executable located in the
"Android\Sdk\platform_tools" from the Windows PowerShell.
     adb push sdcard /

Once a test has been run, use the following command to delete the test data
directories from the target before reloading the test data and rerunning:
     adb shell rm -rf sdcard/EspressoResources sdcard/SPWorkspace

The test data was created by expanding a "002 Lost Coin.bloom" file into a full
story directory called "002 Lost Coin".  The directory was
placed in sdcard/EspressoResources and sdcard/SPWorkspace.  Here are other
files that were added:
     sdcard/SPWorkspace/videos       (directory)
     sdcard/EspressoResources/Lost_Coin.mp4   (file with an mp4 extension)

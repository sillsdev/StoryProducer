                // The new Filter layout for the Story Templates broke the capability to launch
                // the showRegistration () from the calling activity.  SP uses the paradigm of
                // always finishing an activity and then moving onto the next activity.  In this case
                // it would be to finish the current activity and move on to the
                // Registration Activity.  However, when a submit is
                // done from registration, another application such as WhatsApp or Messenger takes
                // over and when they finished, they exit without starting another SP activity.
                // This causes SP to hang in the Splash Activity with no where to go.  This is
                // similar to the issue fixed in
                // Issue #573: SP will hang/crash when submitting registration
                // In that fix, the Main activity does not finish before starting the registration
                // activity.  So, employ the same fix, ie, tell the main activity to display the
                // registration when the main activity is started and then start the main activity

/**
 * The purpose of this class is to make searching for multi-word wordlinks possible and fast within a larger paragraph of text.
 * The point of this class is to quickly differentiate between similar wordlinks (ones which begin with the same words).
 * Example: feast, Feast of Pentecost, Feast of Shelters
 *
 * In this class a word refers to a consecutive string of letters, or any individual non-letter symbol.
 *
 * When building the WordLinkSearchTree (WordLink Search Tree) all starting words of wordlinks that are the same would get combined into a single node.
 * The children of that node would be all the possible next words that could come after the starting word to make up a wordlinks.
 * When searching we would traverse this tree word by word as long as we get words that match.
 * This will get us the longest match - the longest possible wordlinks from a given list of words.

/**
 * The purpose of this class is to make searching for multi-word keyterms possible and fast within a larger paragraph of text.
 * Consider a list of keyterms. Each keyterm gets split into a list of words.
 * The point of this class is to quickly differentiate between keyterms that begin with the same list of words.
 * Example: feast, Feast of Pentecost, Feast of Shelters
 *
 * In this class a word refers to a consecutive string of letters, or any individual non-letter symbol.
 *
 * When building the tree all starting words of keyterms that are the same would get combined into a single node.
 * The children of that node would be all the possible next words that could come after the starting word to make up a keyterm.
 * When searching we would traverse this tree word by word as long as we get words that match.
 * This will get us the longest match- the longest possible keyterm from a given list of words.

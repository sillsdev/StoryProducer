	<h3>Registration Instructions</h3>
	<p><strong><u>What</u></strong><strong>: </strong>There are five &ldquo;drawers&rdquo; (sections) of the Registration. Tap to open (expand) or tap to close each drawer.&nbsp;It is preferable to use English (Roman letters) when filling each field, or English alongside your local script.&nbsp;Inside each drawer, tap on the line of each field to place the cursor there and to bring up the keyboard for inserting the appropriate information.</p>
	<p><strong><u>Who</u></strong>:The SP app trainer should guide the primary translator(s) and accuracy checker in filling out the Registration information. Most of this process is self-explanatory, but a few things will be clarified here.</p>
	<p><strong><u>Purpose</u></strong>: The purpose of filling and submitting this Registration information is (a) to provide a record of contacts and device information about the local language story production team for those involved; (b) to provide some brief analytics to the SP app development team; (c) to make the Registration screen &ldquo;hide&rdquo; so that it does not appear each time the app is opened;</p>
	<p><strong><u>Notes</u></strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is not required to submit the registration information to be able to use the Story Producer app (SP app), but submitting registration information helps the Story Producer team to support you as the user.</li>
		<li>Data that is typed into any Registration drawer or section will be saved automatically.</li>
		<li>If the user taps <strong>SKIP REGISTRATION</strong>, the app will navigate to the Story Templates list.</li>
		<li>To access the Registration screen from anywhere else in the app, tap the <strong>3-line</strong> main menu icon (top left corner of the screen) and tap &ldquo;<strong>Update Registration</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><u>Language Information</u></strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>To find the 3-letter <strong>Ethnologue Code</strong> for your local language, tap the <strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong> button to browse the online ethnologue website.&nbsp; SP Trainers should research this info before any local offline training. If your local language or dialect is not listed on the website, type in the 3-letter code of the most closely related language that is listed, then add a dash (-) followed directly by the first three letters of your local dialect name (e.g. pex-maj). If this field is filled out, the language code will be automatically included in each file name of all the videos created.&nbsp; (When the SP phone is online, Story Producer will automatically send the filename for each new created video to the SP developers&rsquo; nonpublic, secure database and thereby supply simple analytics about what languages and dialects are producing which story videos.)</li>
		<li>To the right of the <strong>Orthography Status</strong> field, there is a small drop-down menu arrow.&nbsp; Tap the arrow and then tap the best choice to describe the status of your local orthography (that is, your language writing system or alphabet).&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong><u>Translator Information</u></strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you want to provide information for more than one translator, simply put a comma after a name and put another name or phone contact, etc. (It is best if the translators for the SP team are located logistically close to each other so that it is not a burden to get together for story production.)</li>
		<li>Translator <strong>Communication Preference</strong> can be indicated by tapping the small drop-down menu arrow and then tapping the preferred option.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong><u>Accuracy Checker Info</u></strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>This drawer is for typing in the information about the one who is qualified and has been chosen to be the &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; or accuracy checker to approve the translation drafts.&nbsp; This person should have some good training and experience as a Bible translator and be familiar with the consultant checking process, with key terms, and perhaps have access to exegetical helps. The SP Trainer is responsible for connecting a qualified Accuracy Checker to each local language team they train.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Accuracy Checker<strong> Communication Preference</strong> can be indicated by tapping the small drop-down menu arrow and then tapping the preferred option.</li>
		<li>It is important to be aware about the <strong>Location Type</strong> drop-down menu!!&nbsp; Most Accuracy Checkers will be <strong>local</strong>.&nbsp; This means that they will be physically on-site or &ldquo;on-sight&rdquo; electronically to view and control the phone and the process during the Accuracy Check phase until the approval passcode is submitted and the last phases of video production are unlocked.&nbsp; When the location type is <strong>local</strong>, the interface of the SP app will have one offline checking phase for each story.&nbsp; If the <strong>remote</strong> location type is chosen, this will <u>trigger</u> the interface of the SP app to change &ndash; the accuracy checking will involve three <u>online</u> interface phases and the approval will be controlled <u>remotely</u> via the ROCC web app.&nbsp; This remote option is not yet available and cannot be utilized.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong><u>Trainer Information</u></strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is self-explanatory.&nbsp; Even if the trainer is the same person as the Accuracy Checker, it is helpful to submit this info.</li>
		<li><strong>Location</strong>.&nbsp; This should be the normal place where the Trainer is located long term (not where the training is done).</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong><u>Archive Information</u></strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>You may or may not have an(other) email contact to place here. If an email is typed in here, and the Registration info is submitted via email, this contact will automatically be placed in the recipient field of the email.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some organization entities may have a contact to which they would like to have all created videos be sent (to keep local records of published materials).&nbsp; Put that contact here and also help the primary translator-story producer to find a way to send a copy of their videos to this contact. (That might be via uploading to a drop box or side-loading to a flash drive etc.)</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong><u>SUBMIT VIA&hellip;</u></strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is ok to submit the Registration info even if some fields are blank.</li>
		<li>Be sure to be online (or have phone connectivity) and actually <strong>send</strong> the Registration text info&nbsp;once an app has been chosen by which to submit the information.</li>
		<li>If the SP app phone is offline, the Registration info can be submitted via Bluetooth to the Trainer&rsquo;s phone. Then when the Trainer is online, s/he can (re)submit the Registration info via email to <a href="mailto:SPapp_info@sil.org">SPapp_info@sil.org</a></li>
		<li>It is preferable to submit the Registration info via email, but other ways are also acceptable.</li>
		<li>Trainers should show the SP phone manager (i.e. the primary translator or local Accuracy Checker) how to update the registration information via the 3-line main menu which can be accessed from any screen.</li>
	</ul>

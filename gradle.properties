# DKH - 07/10/2021 - Issue 407: Add filtering to SP's 'Story Templates' List
# During final integration of pull #561 into sillsdev baseline, the following error was
# encountered during the project clean/build cycle on Android Studio 4.2.2 (JDE 11)
#   Execution failed for task ':app:packageDebug'.
#   > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade
#   > java.lang.OutOfMemoryError (no error message)
# Up the heap space for the JDE for successful compilation
# Was unable to compile at 512m, able to compile at 7536m, so, add some head room & use 1024

# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit

# When building in TeamCity, the build was failing on jetifier.  This worked around it.
